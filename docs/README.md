# Project Architecture
As introduced in the project walkthrough, The vehilce subsystem contains mainly three different parts, perception, planning and control. And each part contains several different ros nodes for different functions. Different ros nodes communicate with each other by subscribing or publishing to interesting ros topics. The project software architecture can be shown as following:

# Traffic Light Detection
An import part of perception in this project is to detect traffic light state from image. Though in simulator the ground truth traffic light state is provided, in real car, we need to get the traffic light state based on image only. And before that, we need to detect the traffic light state from image in simulator too.

In this project, we make use of transfer learning and [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). The main steps can be described as following:
1. Train a model for general traffic light detection and classification
    * Select a pretrained general object detection model from [Tensorflow Object Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).
    * Collect general traffic light detection and classification dataset.
    * Perform transfer learning on the pretrained general object detection model using the traffic light dataset, and get a general traffic light detection and classification model.
2. Train a model based on general traffic light detection and classification for simulator images
    * Collect traffic light detection and classification dataset from simulator.
    * Perform transfer learning on the general traffic light detection and classification model using the simulator traffic light dataset.
    * Use this model in simulator for traffic light detection and classification.
3. Train a model based on general traffic light detection and classification for real world testing environment images
    * Collect traffic light detection and classification dataset from ros bag file provided for real world testing environment.
    * Perform transfer learning on the general traffic light detection and classification model using the real world testing environment traffic light dataset.
    * Use this model in testing car for traffic light detection and classification.

## Selection of pretrained object detection model
Tensorflow provides a lot of pre-trained object detection models in the [Tensorflow Object Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md). Since this part will be running in the real car in real time, speed is quite important, and of course, accuracy is also critical. After trying out several different pretrained models, we finally select [ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz). This model is very fast to run and it is also accurate enough.

## General purpose traffic light dataset
In this project, we use the [Bosch Small Traffic Light Dataset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132) to train the general purpose traffic light detection and classification model. The training set of this dataset contains 15 different labels, however, in our project, we only need 4 different lables, red, yellow, green and off. We preprocessed the test.yaml file and replaced those extra labels with corresponding red, yellow, green or off lable. And also we split the dataset into 80/20. 80% of the samples are used for training and 20% of the samples are used for validation.
